🤝 Negotiation Swarm Using Genetic Algorithm (GA) 🧬
This project implements a negotiation model based on swarm intelligence using a Genetic Algorithm (GA) approach. The system simulates two-way negotiation between a customer and a manufacturing company that sells a product. The negotiation process leverages evolutionary techniques to optimize outcomes for both parties.

🚀 Project Overview
Negotiation between buyers and sellers can be complex, especially when multiple variables and preferences come into play. This project uses a Genetic Algorithm to model and simulate negotiation behaviors dynamically, helping both sides converge on mutually beneficial agreements. The GA explores the solution space by evolving candidate solutions across generations.

✨ Features
🤖 Two-way negotiation model between customer and manufacturing company

🧬 Uses Genetic Algorithm for optimization of negotiation strategies

⏳ Real-time simulation of negotiation rounds

⚙️ Adjustable parameters for GA such as population size, mutation rate, and crossover methods

🧩 Modular and extensible codebase for further research and improvements

⚙️ Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/Mustafaelsayed1/negotiation_swarm-using-GA.git
cd negotiation_swarm-using-GA
(Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:

bash
Copy
Edit
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
▶️ Usage
Run the main script to start the negotiation simulation:

bash
Copy
Edit
python main.py
You can adjust parameters such as population size, number of generations, mutation rate, etc., inside the configuration files or directly in the code.

🔍 How It Works
🚀 Initialization: Start with an initial population of candidate negotiation solutions.

🎯 Evaluation: Each candidate is evaluated using a fitness function representing negotiation success.

🏆 Selection: Select the best candidates to form the next generation.

🔄 Crossover and Mutation: Apply genetic operators to produce offspring solutions.

🔁 Iteration: Repeat the evaluation and evolution process over several generations until convergence or stopping criteria are met.

🎉 Negotiation Outcome: Final negotiation solution is the optimized agreement between customer and manufacturer.
