# 🤝 Negotiation Swarm Using Genetic Algorithm (GA) 🧬

This project implements a negotiation model based on swarm intelligence using a Genetic Algorithm (GA) approach. The system simulates two-way negotiation between a customer and a manufacturing company that sells a product. The negotiation process leverages evolutionary techniques to optimize outcomes for both parties.

## 🚀 Project Overview

Negotiation between buyers and sellers can be complex, especially when multiple variables and preferences come into play. This project uses a Genetic Algorithm to model and simulate negotiation behaviors dynamically, helping both sides converge on mutually beneficial agreements. The GA explores the solution space by evolving candidate solutions across generations.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Mustafaelsayed1/negotiation_swarm-using-GA.git
cd negotiation_swarm-using-GA

# (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the negotiation simulation
python main.py
## 🗂️ Project Structure
The project is organized into the following key files:

app.py
Main application runner that starts the negotiation simulation.

engine.py
Contains the Genetic Algorithm logic and negotiation engine implementation.

fitness.py
Defines the fitness function used to evaluate negotiation candidate solutions.

requirements.txt
Lists all Python dependencies required to run the project.

README.md
Project documentation file (this file).

Other modules and resources
Additional supporting scripts and data files as needed.

##🔍 How It Works
🚀 Initialization: Start with an initial population of candidate negotiation solutions.

🎯 Evaluation: Each candidate is evaluated using a fitness function representing negotiation success.

🏆 Selection: Select the best candidates to form the next generation.

🔄 Crossover and Mutation: Apply genetic operators to produce offspring solutions.

🔁 Iteration: Repeat the evaluation and evolution process over several generations until convergence or stopping criteria are met.

🎉 Negotiation Outcome: Final negotiation solution is the optimized agreement between customer and manufacturer.
